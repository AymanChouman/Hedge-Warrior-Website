    <h1>üïπÔ∏è Hedge Warrior V1 User Guide</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      <b>Hedge Warrior V1</b> is a fully automated MetaTrader 5 Expert Advisor designed to capture profits through a hedged, multi-entry trading strategy. It splits each position into several smaller trades, hedges adverse moves, and dynamically manages risk using trailing stops and advanced closing logic. The EA adapts to market conditions using configurable indicator filters and ensures robust safety via magic number isolation and session controls.

    <h2>Key Inputs &amp; What They Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Time Frame:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          This is the time frame used for all indicator calculations (e.g. 5 Minutes). It does <u>not</u> depend on your chart's current time frame‚Äîset it to match your intended trading rhythm.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Initial Lot:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          The total position size for one cycle (e.g. <b>0.1</b> for BTCUSD).
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Main entries:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          The initial lot is split into this many trades (e.g. <b>10</b>), allowing the EA to capture profit earlier and scale out gradually as price moves in your favor.
          <br>
          The take profit level for each split is distributed evenly from the entry price up to the maximum take profit (the green line). This means each of the 10 split trades has its own TP, and as price reaches each TP, that part of your position is closed and profit is booked.<br>
          When hedging starts, all individual TPs are modified and merged into a single TP at the outer exit (green) line. From that point, all open trades will only close together at the green line, not gradually as before.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Inner Distance %:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          The percentage distance from your entry at which the first hedge is placed (e.g. <b>1.4%</b> for BTCUSD).<br>
          If price moves against your initial position and hits this level, the EA will open a hedge in the opposite direction. If price oscillates back and forth, the EA will continue to hedge and adjust, opening further hedges at each new adverse move, always working to neutralize risk and seek a profitable exit.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Outer Distance Multiplier:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          Multiplies the inner distance to set the take-profit (maximum profit target) for the whole cycle (e.g. <b>0.7 √ó 1.4% = 0.98%</b> from entry). The green line on the chart marks this level‚Äîwhen hit, all remaining trades are closed for profit.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Trailing stop % pre/post hedge:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          A trailing stop moves up with your profit, never down. Whenever your position is in profit, the trailing stop automatically locks in gains. If price pulls back, the trailing stop will close your trades at the locked-in level, so you never lose once in profit. Trailing stops secure unrealized profit as the market moves, and only realize it when the stop is actually hit and trades are closed.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>ATR/ADX/CCI/Stoch/Squeeze/etc.:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          Entry filters and conditions. These indicators help filter out bad trades and adapt to market conditions. If unsure, leave all on their default settings.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Trading start/end hour:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          Defines when new trades can open. This is in Beirut time (server time)‚Äîdo not change to your local time zone.
        </span>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Magic Number:</b>
        <span class="explain">
          A unique identifier for the EA‚Äôs trades. If you want to run Hedge Warrior V1 on multiple charts or symbols at the same time, always use a different magic number for each chart. The magic number is how the EA identifies its own positions and should never be duplicated in two running EAs at once.
        </span>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How the EA Works</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Signal Phase:</b> The EA checks for a valid trading signal using your selected filters, and only within the allowed trading hours.</li>
      <li><b>Entry Phase:</b> Once a signal is found, the EA splits your initial lot into multiple trades and opens them at the market.</li>
      <li>
        <div class="section-title" style="margin-top:1em;">Chart Lines</div>
        <ul class="legend-list">
          <li><span class="circle blue"></span><b>Blue:</b> Shows the buy entry price, or the line at which the EA will place a hedge trade and flip your net position from short to long.</li>
          <li><span class="circle red"></span><b>Red:</b> Shows the sell entry price, or the line at which the EA will place a hedge trade and flip your net position from long to short.</li>
          <li><span class="circle green"></span><b>Green:</b> The maximum take-profit line. When price hits this line, the EA closes the entire cycle and takes profit.</li>
          <li><span class="circle yellow"></span><b>Yellow:</b> The breakeven price for a net long position. This is just an indicative line‚Äîpositions are <b>not</b> closed at this level; it serves as a visual reference for breakeven if you are net long.</li>
          <li><span class="circle orange"></span><b>Orange:</b> The breakeven price for a net short position. This is also only indicative‚Äîpositions are <b>not</b> closed at this level; it is a reference for net short breakeven.</li>
          <li><span class="circle violet"></span><b>Violet:</b> The breakeven line (yellow or orange) turns violet when price has moved by the set trailing percentage in your favor. This indicates trailing has started, and the trailing logic is now active. The violet line is still your breakeven, but now being watched for trailing stop logic. Violet means: trailing is now monitoring your position, but profit is <b>not</b> realized until the trailing stop (aqua) is hit. The trailing stop (aqua) will now appear and track price for exit.</li>
          <li><span class="circle aqua"></span><b>Aqua:</b> The dynamic trailing stop line. This line appears when trailing is active. It follows the price as your trades move into profit, according to the trailing distance you set. If price pulls back to this line, all trades are closed and your unrealized profit becomes realized at that moment. Trailing stops never move backward, only lock in more as price improves.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Hedging:</b> If price hits a hedge line (blue or red), the EA automatically opens an opposite trade to hedge and recover from adverse market moves, flipping your net position if needed. If price oscillates back and forth, new hedges will continue to be placed at each new adverse move, always working to minimize loss and seek a profitable exit. The lot size and position increase with each hedge, and your total exposure and equity drawdown can grow quickly if price continues to move against you and multiple hedges are triggered. The hedge size and behavior depend on the EA's outer distance and internal logic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Closing:</b> Positions can be closed in several ways, in this order of priority:
        <ol type="a">
          <li>Split take profits (TPs) are hit individually and scale out your position, until the next hedge is triggered;</li>
          <li>The trailing stop (aqua) is hit, locking in profit;</li>
          <li>The maximum take profit (green) line is hit, closing all remaining trades together;</li>
          <li>You use the KILL ALL function for an emergency exit.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li><b>Pause/Resume:</b> You can pause the EA to prevent opening new trades. Existing positions stay open and hedging dynamics work as usual. When all open trades are closed, no further cycles will be started until you resume.</li>
      <li><b>Expiry:</b> EA expiry date and time. If the expiry date is reached, no new cycles will start (based on the EA's internal expiry timer), but ongoing trades will be managed to completion.</li>
    </ol>
