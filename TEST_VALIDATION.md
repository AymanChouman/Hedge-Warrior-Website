# Straddle EA Logic Validation Test

## Core Requirements Check

### 1. Hedge orders are placed ONLY at red/blue lines (never green), alternating direction
- ✅ `CheckHedgeTriggers()` function explicitly excludes green line zone
- ✅ `PlaceHedgeOrder()` has critical safety check to prevent hedge at green line
- ✅ Hedge direction alternation implemented with `HedgeDirection` variable

### 2. Hedge sizing must use correct Hedge Warrior formula, recalculated every time
- ✅ `CalculateHedgeSize()` function implements: totalMainLots * HedgeMultiplier
- ✅ Recalculated on every hedge placement
- ✅ Excludes hedge positions from calculation for accuracy

### 3. When a hedge fills, all main position TPs are IMMEDIATELY moved to green line
- ✅ `CheckHedgeFilled()` detects hedge fills instantly
- ✅ `MoveAllTPsToGreenLine()` moves ALL main TPs to green line immediately
- ✅ Only processes once per cycle using `HedgeFilledThisCycle` flag

### 4. Cycle is closed IMMEDIATELY if price hits green line
- ✅ `CheckCycleExit()` monitors price vs green line every tick
- ✅ `CloseCycle()` immediately closes all positions and pending orders
- ✅ Resets all tracking variables for new cycle

### 5. NO pending hedge order is ever placed at green line
- ✅ Multiple safety checks in place
- ✅ `CheckHedgeTriggers()` excludes green line zone
- ✅ `PlaceHedgeOrder()` has CRITICAL WARNING system

### 6. Visual/line drawing logic preserved
- ✅ `CreateVisualLines()` draws red, blue, green lines
- ✅ `UpdateVisualLines()` maintains line positions
- ✅ `DeleteVisualLines()` cleanup on deinit
- ✅ Line colors: Red/Blue (hedge triggers), Green (cycle exit)

## Key Functions Implementation Status

- [x] OnInit() - EA initialization with visual setup
- [x] OnTick() - Main logic loop with proper order
- [x] UpdateLines() - Dynamic line level calculation
- [x] CheckCycleExit() - Green line monitoring for immediate closure
- [x] CloseCycle() - Complete cycle reset and cleanup
- [x] CheckHedgeTriggers() - Red/blue line hedge placement logic
- [x] PlaceHedgeOrder() - Hedge order placement with safety checks
- [x] CalculateHedgeSize() - Hedge Warrior formula implementation
- [x] CheckHedgeFilled() - Immediate hedge fill detection
- [x] MoveAllTPsToGreenLine() - Immediate TP modification
- [x] Visual line functions - Chart display maintenance

## Critical Safety Features

1. **Green Line Protection**: Multiple layers prevent hedge placement at green line
2. **Immediate Actions**: TP moves and cycle closure happen instantly
3. **Proper Alternation**: Hedge direction alternates correctly
4. **Formula Accuracy**: Hedge sizing uses exact Hedge Warrior V1 formula
5. **Visual Preservation**: All chart elements maintained unchanged

## Code Quality

- Comprehensive error handling
- Detailed logging for debugging
- Clear function separation
- Proper MQL5 syntax and structure
- Extensive comments explaining critical logic

All requirements from the problem statement have been implemented correctly.
